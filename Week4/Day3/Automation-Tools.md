# Automation Tools

### Junit
Junit is a popular testing framework that is very good at creating unit tests. Unit tests are snippets of code that verify the behavior of your application. For today's purposes, Junit integrates well with the main testing framework we will be using called Cucumber. 

### Cucumber*
Cucumber is a testing framework that is capable of turning acceptance critera into executable code. This will allow us to take any user stories we have converted into acceptance criteria and we will be able to simulate a user actually taking the actions necessary to complete each step of the acceptance critera.

### Selenium*
Selenium is a web browser automation tool. While this technology is often used for automation testing, it is not in itself a testing software.
