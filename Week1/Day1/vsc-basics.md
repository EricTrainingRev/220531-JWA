# VSC Basics
There are a few basic components to Visual Studio Code you should be aware of.

### The Explorer
this window is where you can see what folder you have open, the sub-folders (sometimes called sub-directories) inside of it, and the various files stored inside of the directory and sub-directories

### The Workspace
This is the window I am currently typing in. You can have multiple files open at a time, and vsc will create tabs for them at the top of the workspace window. If a tab has a white dot next to its name it means that it has unsaved changes. To save your files you can either click ctr + s for each file, or you can save all by going to the file option at the top of the vsc window and choosing the save all option (you can also save files individually this way).

### The Terminal
We will be using a terminal to actually run our code that we write. We can also use it to navigate our directories, create files, even write/edit files if need be.

### Extensions
Part of the reason VSC has become so popular is because it is very easy to add extension to VSC to make it do what you want it to do. For instance, there is an extension that makes sure VSC is using the most up-to-date Javascript so that you don't accidentally use depricated(old) code. There are many other extensions we will be using as the training goes along

### All together: IDE
An Integrated Development Environment is software that helps with writing code. Usually, an IDE will contain features that give intelisense (helpful hints) for your code, provide error messages if you write bad code (warnings) and will usually provide a way of executing your code.
