# What is a runtime environment?
Fundamentally, a runtime environment is software that allows you to execute code. It contains the means of letting your code you write interact with your computer to do whatever it is you have designed it to do. For our purposes today we will be starting off simple: we will make it so our Javascript code writes different messages or outputs for us in the terminal

### What does it mean to compile?
When we write our code it is understandable (usually) by us developers, but not by the computer. Compiling code is the process of turning what we have written into executable instructions by the computer. The runtime environment helps with this process.
