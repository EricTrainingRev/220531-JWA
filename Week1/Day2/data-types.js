/*
    Javascript has 7 basic data types called Primitives. These data types represent the most basic pieces of
    information in your code. These types are the following
    1. string
        - you can create strings by placing characters and numbers between "", '', ``
    2. number
        - a number like 1, 23, 5.7, etc.
    3. bigInt
        - numbers larger than 2^(53-1) power are big ints
    4. boolean
        - these represent true and false from a logical perspective
    5. null
        - this value is used when a variable does not point to any other data
    6. undefined
        - if you create a variable that does not reference anything then it starts as undefined
    7. symbol
        - this is a data type that was added a year or two ago to JavaScript, it is highly uncommon

// 9/10 times I will use the formatting of stringOne
stringOne = "My friend said 'this is a great pizza!'";
stringTwo = 'My friend said, "I love ice cream!"';
stringThree = 
`This is a multi line
string that will work even if the string
spans multiple lines`;
