/*
   Before we get started with writing our code we need to know what variables are. Variables are ways of referencing 
   data in our code and they provide a convinient way of reusing our data throughout our code. JavaScript uses what
   is called the "camelCase" naming convention. When naming your variables you want there to be no spaces between
   any unique words in the name of the variable, the first unique word should be all lowercase, and all unique
   words after it should start with an uppercase first letter

   examples:
      name
      firstName
      firstAndLastName
*/

firstName = "Eric";
lastName = "Suminski";

console.log(firstName);
console.log(firstName);
console.log(lastName);
console.log(lastName);

/*
   Step 1: you have to define your variable
      firstName
   Step 2: assign your variable a value using the assignment operator =
      firstName =
   Step 3: determine what data the variable is a reference to
      firstName = "Eric"
