# Static Mad Lib
This exercise involves creating a mad lib that will generate the missing words via the variables you create. For the sake of simplicity your mad lib should be no more than a paragraph or two, and you should aim to fill in no more than 10 blanks in the story. Make sure your variables are named well (noun1, verb2, adjectiveOne, etc). For an added challenge, try looking up how to use template literals [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals), or how to craft long strings [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#long_literal_strings)
