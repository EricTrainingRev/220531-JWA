# Instructions
because Node is not going to be our main means of creating/running applications we won't spend too much time on this, so these are going to be watered-down instructions for using code from the node repository.
1. you need to run the command below in the terminal: this will allow us to start downloading code from the web to use in this folder
```cli
npm init -y
```
2. you need to run this command next in the terminal: it will actually download the JavaScript code that we need to easily get user input in the terminal
```cli
npm i prompt-sync
```
