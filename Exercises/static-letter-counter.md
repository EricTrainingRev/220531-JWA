# Static Letter Counter
using the control flow tools you have learned, write a script that will count how many vowels are in your name and print a message stating how many there are to the console. For instance, if I provide the name Eric I should get a message back saying something like "vowels in your name: 2". Use only the tools and skills you have learned in training to make your script (no googling how to get user input: everything should be handle by creating variables and manually changing them before you execute your script).

### Stretch Goals
- count how many total words there are in the name
- count how many consonants there are in the name
