/*
    The code writing challenges in this module are designed to help you become more familiar with how the different
    control flow tools available to you work. For each challenge you will be given a snipet of code and instructions
    for what you need to do to make the code work. Make sure to remove the initial values provided for the while
    statements
*/

/*
    Exercise One: make the while loop below print the numbers 0-10, increase the number printed by one each 
    iteration. The console should look like this after running the script:
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10

    HINT: create a variable outside the loop to control how many times the while loop will run
*/

while(false){

}

/*
    Exercise two: make the while loop below print the even numbers from 0 to 20, one at a time. The console should
    look like this after executing the script:
    2
    4
    6
    8
    10
    12
    14
    16
    18
    20

    HINT: this requires more fine-tune control over the increment of your control variable
*/

while(false){

}

/*
    Exercise Three: make the while loop below print the odd numbers from 30 through 0, one at a time. The console 
    should look like this after running the script:
    29
    27
    25
    23
    21
    19
    17
    15
    13
    11
    9
    7
    5
    3
    1

    HINT: there is a mathematical operator that can help simplify your code logic
*/

while(false){

}

/*
    Exercise Four: without removing the hard-coded false boolean from the while statement, adjust the code below
    so that the message will still print to the console once. HINT: There are two kinds of while loops you can
    create: one checks the boolean before execution, the other checks it after execution
*/

while(false){
    console.log("if you see this then you are done with exercise four");
