/*
    The code writing challenges in this module are designed to help you become more familiar with how the different
    control flow tools available to you work, and how different data structures work. For each challenge you will 
    be given a snipet of code and instructions for what you need to do to make the code work.

/*
    Exercise One: assign an empty object to the variable "myObject" below
*/

let myObject;
/*
    Exercise Two: add a string value and a number value to the empty object you created above. Make the key for
    the numeric value a number as well. HINT: objects have two ways of creating new key/value pairs
*/

// write code here

/*
    Exercise Three: print the numeric and string values that you added to the object above. HINT: objects have two
    ways of accessing their keys

console.log(/* print the other value here */);

/*
    Exercise Four: remove the string element from the array in a way that makes it so only the number element
    remains in the array. HINT: arrays have built in methods of removing the first and last elements in the array
