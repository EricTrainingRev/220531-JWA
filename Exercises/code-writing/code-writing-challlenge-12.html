    <!-- 
    The challenges in this file are designed to help you become more familiar with how to work with
    html, css, and JavaScript. For each challenge you will be given instructions for what you need to do to 
    complete the exercise. Note that all exercises in this file should be handled by writing code in the script
    section below
     -->

     <!-- 
        Exercise One: Use JavaScript to create a header element that says "I made this with JavaScript" and add it
        to your web page HINT: you can reference the body of the web page using "document.body"
      -->

     <!-- 
        Exercise Two: Use JavaScript to make an ordered list and list your top 5 stories in order on the web page
        after the header you created in exercise one HINT: textContent is the property that represents the text
        in-between tags
      -->

     <!-- 
        Exercise Three: Use JavaScript to make a times table for the numbers 1 through 5 and add it to the web page
        under the ordered list you created above HINT: you can either use loops to dynamically generate the content
        of the table, or you can use the innerHTML property to manually write out the tags/text of the table NOTE:
        this exercise is one of the harder ones I have created so far, ask for help if you can't figure it out
      -->

     <!-- 
        Exercise Four: You must complete exercise three before this one. Make all the even numbers in the times
        table above green, all the odd numbers red, and make the numbers that represent the rows (so the top row and
        the first column on the left) purple. HINT: you can either add css selectors (like an Id or class) to the
        cells, or you can gather the data in a collection and loop through the collection to apply styling
      -->
