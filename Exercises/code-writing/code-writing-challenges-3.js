/*
    The code writing challenges in this module are designed to help you become more familiar with how the different
    control flow tools available to you work. For each challenge you will be given a snipet of code and instructions
    for what you need to do to make the code work. Make sure to remove the true/false booleans in each statement
    while working on the exercises.
