    sometimes you will need to take information you acquired on one page and transfer it to another. A handy
    but very unsecure way of handling this is local/sessions storage. Local storage is a collection of key value pairs
    that exist in your browser until you clear them. Session storage is limited to the tab in which the session
    value is set, and it will be delted upon either the tab or entire browser being closed
