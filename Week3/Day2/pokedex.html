    /*
        to get a pokemon's information from the pokeAPI we will need to create a function that will make the 
        http request for us when we click on the button in the html body.

        to make this function work we are going to need to use the async and await keywords because when we make
        our http request the function we are going to use will return a Promise object by default. The async
        keyword will give our function we are creating access to the await keyword. The await keyword can be used
        with a promise to automatically resolve the promise when the expected information is recieved
