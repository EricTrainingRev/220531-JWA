## HTTP
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is the most popular way of sending/recieving information across the web. It is a request/response system that gurantees the requester a response, even if that response is only to say that everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong.
- **request**
    - this is the information that you send to an API (application program interface) that has some information you want back
- **response**
    - this is the information that you get back from the API you make a request to

## JSON
JavaScript Object Notation is the most common way of storing information that is transfered across the web. JSONs are essentially just formatted strings. A typical JSON will look something like this:
```JSON
{
    "keyOne":"value one",
    "2":10,
    "myBoolean":false

}
```
JSONs can work with Strings, numbers, and booleans. They can also be stored in lists, and you can nest JSONs inside of other JSONs.
