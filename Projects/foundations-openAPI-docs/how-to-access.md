# instructions for accessing your fastAPI documentation
to view the documentation for your API you simply need to use the /docs path alongside your specific api url. so, if you were assigned the url with the id 0 you would go to: https://bugcatcher.coe.revaturelabs.com/0/docs. The fastAPI documentation you see not only tells you how to interact with your API, but it also allows you to interact with it from the documentation page. This makes it easy to set up your database with testers and managers that you will need to make other routes work (like loging in, creating defects, updating defects, etc.).

### NOTE
Please make sure to only interact with your assigned API.
