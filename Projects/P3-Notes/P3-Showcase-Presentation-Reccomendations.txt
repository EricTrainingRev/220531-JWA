Aim for your presentation to be ~30 minutes
Everyone should speak at least once
If possible, try to have only one person share their screen
Have a powerpoint for when you are not showing off your tests/application
	- make sure the powerpoint is auxilary to your presentation: you should not just be reading off the powerpoint
Everyone should have their part/s of the presentation written out
You should practice the presentation 3-5 times if possible

REMEMBER: this showcase is your chance to show off what you have accomplished: focus on the positives of the project, not the negatives
